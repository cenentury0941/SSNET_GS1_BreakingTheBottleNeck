# SSNET_GS1_BreakingTheBottleNeck
Project Submission for GS1 Breaking the Bottleneck Hackathon by Team Analyst Soul


INSTRUCTIONS:
The system uses the mern stack, thus the front end uses ReactJS while the Backend uses NodeJS and MongoDB.

IMPORTANT : As the project uses MongoDB as the backend, access to database may not be possible for the public. In case database access is required for testing purposes, feel free to send me an email.

For setting up the node.js back-end:
- cd into mern/server
- execute :  node server.js

For setting up the front-end:
- cd into mern/client
- execute : npm install
- execute : npm start

ABOUT:
Stock Sourcing Network or SSNet is a planned Deep Learning AI backed Supply Chain management system which autonomously links local suppliers to local consumers in the most optimal manner possible. This is done by registering both the suppliers (such as factories or warehouses) as well as consumers (such as retailers) onto our online portal. Through this portal, suppliers can provide us with their location, inventory, logistical capabilities and other relevant information and consumers can provide their location, stock requirements, budget and other relevant information. By gathering this information, we can then allow our trained model to factor in the variables as well as historic data and calculate a cost factor to ship a single unit of material from a given supplier to a given consumer. This calculation is performed for every possible supplier and consumer pair for each item in that is required and once done, this data can then be used to calculate how much of what needs to be shipped from where to where in order to optimise cost and ensure uniform throughput of resources.
